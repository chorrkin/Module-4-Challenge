## Module 4 Challenge â€“ PyCity Schools Analysis

This project is part of the Module 4 Challenge and demonstrates how to use **Pandas** to clean, transform, and analyze educational data from a fictional school district, *PyCity*. The goal is to evaluate math and reading scores across all schools in the district.

The analysis includes:

- Merging student and school datasets
- Grouping and summarizing key performance metrics
- Comparing performance by school type, grade level, and school size
- Evaluating budget vs. performance trends

The code in this repository works with the provided CSV files containing the raw data.

---
> To run the analysis, make sure the `Resources/schools_complete.csv` and `Resources/students_complete.csv` files are in the correct directory relative to the script.
